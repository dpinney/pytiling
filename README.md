GOAL
====
Python tiling library.

TASKS
=========
XXX What are my options? PNG tiles/SVG tiles/dynamic SVG/dynamic canvas.
XXX What language should I use? Do it in Python then port to Javascript if I really need to.
XXX Switch class to use slots? Nah. Later if I really want to lock down the interface.
XXX How do I want to handle hatching? I made it an option.
XXX What's the difference between a tiling and a tessellations? Tessellations contain only regular polygons.
XXX Can I make all the polygon coordinates exact in terms of sqrts etc.?
XXX Where's that x-y lock code that Brendan wrote? I've got a backup in there. It's alright.
XXX Remove all whitespace.
XXX Use snabbt.js? Nah.
XXX Output formats? PDF, SVG, PNG, view live.
XXX How do I crop it? 2 clear options: manual crop, show everything crop (minMax).
XXX Does this help http://qrohlf.com/trianglify/? We're not doing tilings generated by javascript in the browser at this time.
XXX What about interactive tiling creation interface? Difficult, unclear goals.
XXX Play with coloration? Maybe use this: http://llllll.li/randomColor/ Going with matplotlib's built in colors instead.
OOO How to get a really nice crop? Perfectly square.
OOO What if I made a polygon group object? Might be the natural place to put tiling/drawing functionality.
OOO Can I build all regular/semiregular/demiregular tesselations?
OOO Pip install, put on pypi, advertise on hacker news.
OOO Colors? Sample matplotlib color maps.
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
color_list = plt.cm.Set3(np.linspace(0, 1, 12)) # http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_summary.html
print color_list
