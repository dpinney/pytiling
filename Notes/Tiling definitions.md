### Tiling (Mathworld)

"[A] tiling is a collection of disjoint open sets, the closures of which cover the plane."

Not all tilings are periodic: "Wang's conjecture (1961) stated that if a set of tiles tiled the plane, then they could always be arranged to do so periodically. A periodic tiling of the plane by polygons or space by polyhedra is called a tessellation. The conjecture was refuted in 1966 when R. Berger showed that an aperiodic set of 20,426 tiles exists. By 1971, R. Robinson had reduced the number to six and, in 1974, R. Penrose discovered an aperiodic set (when color-matching rules are included) of two tiles: the so-called Penrose tiles. It is not known if there is a single aperiodic tile."

A single polygon can tile the plane. For triangles and quadrilaterals, any polygon of that type will tile the plane. For pentagons and hexagons, there are 14 and 3 known tilings respectively. More could exist. "There are no tilings for identical convex n-gons for n>=7, although non-identical convex heptagons can tile the plane".

### Tessellation (MathWorld)

"A tiling of _regular_ polygons (in two dimensions), polyhedra (three dimensions), or polytopes ( dimensions) is called a tessellation."

...

There are 3 regular tessellations (using only one polygon), 8 semiregular (two polygons) and 14 demiregular (three polygon) tessellations.
